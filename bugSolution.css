One potential solution to avoid the unexpected results is to avoid combining percentages and other units within the `calc()` function. Instead, use only one unit type within the calculation. For example, if you want to set the width of an element to 50% of its container plus 10 pixels, consider setting the width in percentage or pixels only, but not both at the same time.  A safer approach would involve breaking down the styling into separate declarations.  This ensures predictable and consistent width for your element in different contexts:

```css
.element { 
  width: 50%;
  margin-left: 10px;
  /* Or adjust padding as necessary */
}
```

This approach avoids the ambiguity of combining units within the `calc()` function.  Adjust the `margin-left` (or `padding-left`) value depending on whether you want to increase the size of the element by 10 pixels. Note that adding margin or padding would have implications on the total space occupied by the element, so you should adapt the solution accordingly to your specific layout requirements.  In more complex situations, using JavaScript might be necessary for dynamically calculating sizes.
