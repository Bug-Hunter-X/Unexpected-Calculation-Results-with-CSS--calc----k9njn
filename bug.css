The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there is a potential bug when using `calc()` with percentages and other units. For example, consider this CSS code:

```css
.element { 
  width: calc(50% + 10px); 
}
```

This code intends to set the width of the `.element` to 50% of its container plus 10 pixels. However, this may not work as expected in all browsers or situations. Some browsers might misinterpret the calculation and produce unexpected results.
